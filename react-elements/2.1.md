# What is a React node?

The primary type or value that is created when using React is what is known as a React node. A React node is defined as:

 > a light, stateless, immutable, virtual representation of a DOM node.

React nods are thus, not real DOM nodes (e.g. text or element node) themselves, but a representation of an actual DOM node. The representation is considered the virtual DOM. In a nutshell, React is used to define a virtual DOM using React nodes that are eventually used to created an actual DOM structured inside of an HTML page.

React nodes can be created using JSX or JavaScript. In this chapter we'll  look at creating React nodes using JavaScript.
