# What is a React element?

The primary type or value that is created when using React is what is known as a React element. A React element is defined as:

 > a light, stateless, immutable, virtual representation of a DOM Element.

React elements are thus, not real DOM elements themselves, but a representation of an actual DOM element. The representation is considered the virtual DOM. In a nutshell, React is used to define a virtual DOM using React elements that are eventually used to created an actual DOM structured inside of an HTML page.

React elements can be created using JSX or JavaScript. In this chapter we'll  look at creating React elements using JavaScript.
