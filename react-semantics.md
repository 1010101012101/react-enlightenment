# React Semantics

Before I enlighten anyone with the mechanics of React I'd first like to define a few terms so as to grease the learning process. 

Below I define many of the terms that are used when talking about React.

**Babel**: - Babel is a generic multi-purpose compiler for JavaScript. Using Babel you can use (and create) the next generation of JavaScript, as well as the next generation of JavaScript tooling.
