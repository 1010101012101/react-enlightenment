# React Semantics

Before I enlighten anyone with the mechanics of React I'd first like to define a few terms so as to grease the learning process. 

Below I define the most common terms used when talking about React.

**Babel**: - Babel is a generic multi-purpose compiler for JavaScript. Using Babel you can use (and create) the next generation of JavaScript, as well as the next generation of JavaScript tooling. Babel is the tool of choice from the React team for writing future ES* and transforming JSX to ES5 code.

**ES5**: - The 5th edition of the ECMAScript standard. The ECMAScript 5.1 edition was finalized on June 2011.

**ES6**: - The 6th edition of the ECMAScript standard. AKA JavaScript 2015. The ECMAScript 6th edition was finalized on June 2015.

**ECMAScript 2016**: - Name of the specification that will provide updates to the JavaScript language in 2016. This edition of ECMAScript is still working towards being finalization.

**ES\***: - Used to represent the current version of JavaScript as well as potential future versions that can written today using tools like Babel. When you see "ES*" it more than likely means you'll find uses of ES5, ES6, and ES7 together.

**JSX**: - JSX is an optional XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript that can be used to define a tree structure consisting of components.

**Virtual DOM** - A JavaScript tree of React elements/components that is used for efficient re-rendering (i.e. diffing via JavaScript) of the browser DOM.
