# React Semantics

Before I enlighten anyone with the mechanics of React I'd first like to define a few terms so as to grease the learning process. 

Below I define many of the terms that are used when talking about React.

**Babel**: - Babel is a generic multi-purpose compiler for JavaScript. Using Babel you can use (and create) the next generation of JavaScript, as well as the next generation of JavaScript tooling.

**JSX**: - JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself. It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.
