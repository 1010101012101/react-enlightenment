# Creating React nodes with JSX

Working off the knowledge given in the previous chapter you should be familiar with creating React nodes using the `React.createElement()` function. For example, using this function one can create React nodes that are both HTML DOM nodes and custom HTML DOM nodes. Below I use this familiar function to create two React nodes. 

```js
//React node, which represents an actual HTML DOM node
var HTMLLi = React.createElement('li', {className:'bar'}, 'foo');

//React node, which represents a custom HTML DOM node
var HTMLCustom = React.createElement('foo', {className:'bar'}, 'foo');
```

To use JSX instead of `React.createElement()` to create these React nodes one just has to replace `React.createElement()` function calls with the HTML/XML like tags which represent the HTML you'd like the virtual DOM to spit out. The above code can be written with JSX like so.

```js
//React node, which represents an actual HTML DOM node
var HTMLLi = <li className="bar">foo</li>;

//React node, which represents a custom HTML DOM node
var HTMLCustom = <foo className="bar" >foo</foo>;
```

Notice that the JSX is not in a string format and can just be writing as if you are writing it inside of an `.html` file. As stated many times already JSX is then transformed back into the `React.createElement()` functions calls by Babel. You can see the transformation occurring in the following JSFiddle.

If you were to examine the actual HTML produced in the above JSfiddle it would look like so:

```html
<body>
    <div id="app1"><li class="bar" data-reactid=".0">foo</li></div>

    <div id="app2"><foo class="bar" data-reactid=".1">foo</foo></div>
</body>
```

#### Notes

* JSX tags support the XML self close syntax so you can optionally leave the closing tag off when no child node is used.
