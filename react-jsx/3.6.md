 # Using inline CSS styles in JSX

In order to define inline styles on JSX (and thus React nodes) you pass the `style` prop/attribute a reference to a JavaScript object containing CSS properties and values.

In the code below first setup a JavaScript object containing my inlines styles, then I use the { } brackets to reference the object. 

[source code](https://jsfiddle.net/4pw9w9h7/#tabs=js,result,html,resources)

When the JSX is transformed by Babel the resulting HTML will be:

```html
<div style="color:red;background-color:black;font-weight:bold;" data-reactid=".0">test</div>
```

Notice that, the CSS properties are in a camelCased form [similar to what is used when writing CSS in JavaScript due to the fact that JavaScript does not allow hyphens in names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference).
