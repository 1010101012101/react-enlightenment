# Using JavaScript comments in JSX

You can place JavaScript comments anywhere in React/JSX you want except locations where JSX might expect a React child node. In this situation you'll have to escape the comment using `{ }` so that JSX knows to pass that on as actual JavaScript.

Examine the code below, read the comments so you understand where you'll have to tell JSX to pass along a JS comment so a child node is not created.

```js
//Note where JS comments must be encapsulated inside of { }
var reactNode = (/*comment*/ <label>{label} {/* use {} here to comment*/} = 
                  <input /*comment*/ type={inputType} value={2+2} />{/* use {} here to comment*/}
                  </label>
                ); //comment
```
