# Using JavaScript comments in JSX

You can place JavaScript comments anywhere in React/JSX you want except locations where JSX might expect a child element or text node. In this situation you'll have to escape the comment using `{ }`` so that JSX knows to pass that on as actual JavaScript.

Examine the code below, read the comments so you understand where you'll have to tell JSX to pass along a JS comment instead of creating a child node.

```js
var reactNode = (<label>{label} = 
                  <input /*comment*/ type={inputType} value={2+2} />{/*comment*/}
                  </label>); //comment
```
