# Using JavaScript comments in JSX

You can place JavaScript comments anywhere in React/JSX you want except locations where JSX might expect a React child node. In this situation you'll have to escape the comment using `{ }` so that JSX knows to pass that on as actual JavaScript.

Examine the code below, read the comments so you understand where you'll have to tell JSX to pass along a JS comment so a child node is not created.

```js
//Note where JS comments must be encapsulated inside of { }
var reactNode = <div /*comment*/>{/* use {} here to comment*/}</div>;
```

In the above code if I had not wrapped the comment inside of the <div> with `{ }` brackets then Babel would have converted the comment to a text node. The outcome, without the `{ }` would be:

```js
var reactNode = React.createElement(
  "div",
  null,
  "/* use ",
  " here to comment*/"
);
```
