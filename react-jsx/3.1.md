# What is JSX?

JSX is an XML-like syntax that extends ECMAScript so that HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript code. The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e. transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript that a JavaScript engine will parse.

Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML structures (DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript and Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. 

By using JSX one can write this in JavaScript:

```js
return ( 
   <ul id="nav">
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Clients</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact Us</a></li>
   </ul>
);
```

Instead of this (but this is exactly what Babel produces):

```js
React.createElement(
   "ul",
   { id: "nav" },
   React.createElement(
      "li",
      null,
      React.createElement(
         "a",
         { href: "#" },
         "Home"
      )
   ),
   React.createElement(
      "li",
      null,
      React.createElement(
         "a",
         { href: "#" },
         "About"
      )
   ),
   React.createElement(
      "li",
      null,
      React.createElement(
         "a",
         { href: "#" },
         "Clients"
      )
   ),
   React.createElement(
      "li",
      null,
      React.createElement(
         "a",
         { href: "#" },
         "Contact Us"
      )
   )
);
```


The idea of mixing HTML and JavaScript in the same file can be a rather contentious topic. Ignore the debate. Use it if you find it helpful. If not, write the React code required to create React nodes. Your choice. My opinion is that JSX provides a concise and familiar syntax for defining a tree structure with attributes that does not require learning a templating language or leaving JavaScript. Both of which are can be a win when building large applications.
