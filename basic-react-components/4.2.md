# Creating React Components

A state-full React component can be created by calling the `React.createClass()` function. This function takes one argument object used to specify the details of the component. The available specification options are:

* `render` - Function that returns React nodes, React Components, or null/false
* `getInitialState` - Object containing initial value of `this.state`
* `getDefaultProps` - Object containing values to be set on `this.props`
* `propTypes` - Object containing [validation specifications for props](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation)
* `mixins` - Array of mixins to share among components
* `statics` - Object containing static mehtods
* `displayName` - String, naming the component, used in debugging messages. If using JSX this is set automatically.
* `componentWillMount` - Callback function invoked once immediately before the initial rendering occurs
* `componentDidMount` - Callback function immediately after the initial rendering occurs
* `componentWillReceiveProps` - Callback function invoked when a component is receiving new props
* `shouldComponentUpdate` - Callback function invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received
* `componentWillUpdate` - Callback function invoked immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received.
* `componentDidUpdate` - Callback function invoked immediately after the component's updates are flushed to the DOM
* `componentWillUnmount` - Callback function invoked immediately before a component is unmounted from the DOM
