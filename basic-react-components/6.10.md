# Re-rendering A Component

When creating a component you should already know after reading the first part of this chapter that calling `ReactDom.render()` will start the rendering of a component and all sub components.

After that, a re-rendered will occur when:

1. A components `setState()` method is called
2. A components `forceUpdate()` method is called

Anytime a component is re-render (or render'ed) all of its children components are render'ed inside of the virtual DOM possibly causing a change to the real DOM (i.e. the UI).

In the code example below `ReactDOM.render(< App / >, app);` start the first cascade of rendering, rendering `<App />` and `<Timer/>`. Then the `setInterval()` calls the `setState()` component method, which causes `<App />` and `<Timer/>` to be re-rendered. Note the UI changes when the state is changed. Lastly, using a `setTimeout()` I set the state on the `<App>` component wrongly (i.e. `this.state.now = 'foo';`), to demonstrate that `forceUpdate()` will cause a re-render of `<App />` and `<Timer />` that results in the UI show the string 'foo'.
