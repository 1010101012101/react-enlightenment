# Re-rendering A Component

You likely realize that calling `ReactDom.render()` is the initial kicking off of the rendering of a component and all sub components.

After the initial mounting of components, a re-rendering will occur when:

1. A component's `setState()` method is called
2. A component's `forceUpdate()` method is called

Anytime a component is re-rendered (or initially rendered) all of its children components are rendered inside of the virtual DOM possibly causing a change to the real DOM (i.e., the UI). The distinction I am making here is that just because a component is re-rendered in the virtual DOM, it does not always follow that an update to the DOM will occur.

In the code example below `ReactDOM.render(< App / >, app);` starts the first cascade of rendering, rendering `<App />` and `<Timer/>`. The next re-render occurs when the `setInterval()` calls the `setState()` component method, which causes `<App />` and `<Timer/>` to be re-rendered. Note the UI changes when the `now` state is changed.

 The next re-render occurs when the `setTimeout()` is invoked and `this.forceUpdate()` is called. Note that simply updating the state (i.e., `this.state.now = 'foo';`) does not cause a re-render. I set the state using `this.state`, and then I have to call `this.forceUpdate()` so the component will re-render with the new state.

 ***NEVER UPDATE THE STATE USING `this.state.`, DID IT HERE TO SHOW USE OF `this.forceUpdate()`.***
