# Re-rendering A Component

You should already know that calling `ReactDom.render()` is the initial kicking off of the rendering of a component and all sub components.

After that, a re-rendered will occur when:

1. A components `setState()` method is called
2. A components `forceUpdate()` method is called

Anytime a component is re-render (or render'ed) all of its children components are render'ed inside of the virtual DOM possibly causing a change to the real DOM (i.e. the UI). The distinction I am making here is that just because a component is re-render in the virtual DOM, it does not follow always that an update to the DOM will occur.

In the code example below `ReactDOM.render(< App / >, app);` starts the first cascade of rendering, rendering `<App />` and `<Timer/>`. The next re-render occurs when the `setInterval()` calls the `setState()` component method, which causes `<App />` and `<Timer/>` to be re-rendered.

Note the UI changes (i.e. the  DOM) when the state is changed. The next re-render occurs when the `setTimeout()` is invoked and the state on the `<App>` component is updated (i.e. `this.state.now = 'foo';`) causing a re-render of `<App />` and `<Timer />`, that results in the UI show the string 'foo' (NEVER UPDATE THE STATE LIKE I JUST DID, DID IT ONLY TO SHOW USE OF `this.forceUpdate()`).
