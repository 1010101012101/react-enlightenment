# Composing Components

If it is not obvious React components can make use of other React components. That is, when defining a component the `render` configuration function can contain references to other components. When a component contains another component it can be said that the parent component owns the child component (aka composition).

In the code below the `BadgeList` component contains/owns the `BadgeBill` and `BadgeTom` component.

### Notes

* This code was purposefully simplistic in order to demonstrate component composition. In the next chapter will look at how this code in this section almost always is written using props to create a generic Badge component that take any name value.
