# Referring to a component instance

When a component is `render`'ed', a React component instance is created from the passed configuration options. One can gain access to this instance and it's properties (e.g. `this.props`) and methods (e.g. `this.setState`) in two ways.

The first way is by using the `this` keyword from within a configuration function option. In the code example below all of the `console.log(this)` statements will refer to the component instance.

The other way to gain a reference to a component instance involves making use of the return value from calling `ReactDOM.render()`. In other words, the `ReactDOM.render()` function will return a reference to the top most rendered component.
