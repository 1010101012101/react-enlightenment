# Referring to a component instance

When a component is `render`'d', a React component instance is created from the passed configuration options. One can gain access to this instance and it's properties and methods (aka component API) in two ways.

The first way is by using the `this` keyword from within a configuration function option. In the code example below all of the `console.log(this)` statements will refer to the component instance.

The other way to gain a reference to a component instance involves making use of the return value from calling `ReactDOM.render()`. In other words, the `ReactDOM.render()` function will return a reference to the top most rendered component.
