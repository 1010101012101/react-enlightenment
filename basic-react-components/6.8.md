# Grokking Component Lifecycle's

React components live certain life events that are called lifecycle's. These lifecycle's events are tied to lifecycle methods. I discussed several of these methods in section 6.2, because these methods are component configuration values set when defining/creating a component.

The lifecycle methods provide hooks into the phases and the nature of a component. In the code example, take from section 6.2 (altered to unmount once it counts to 65), I am console logging the occurrence of the lifecycle `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`, and `getInitialState` lifecycle methods.

The methods can be divided into three categories (Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting).

Below I show a table for each category and the containing lifecycle methods.

###Mounting:

<table>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><p>getInitialState()</p></td>
    <td><p>is invoked before a component is mounted. Stateful components should implement this and return the initial state data.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td><p>componentWillMount()</p></td>
	<td><p>is invoked immediately before mounting occurs.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td><p>componentDidMount()</p></td>
	<td><p>is invoked immediately after mounting occurs. Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

###Updating:

<table>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><p>componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)</p></td>
    <td><p>is invoked when a mounted component receives new props. This method should be used to compare this.props and nextProps to perform state transitions using this.setState().</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td><p>shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)</p></td>
	<td><p>is invoked when a component decides whether any changes warrant an update to the DOM. Implement this as an optimization to compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false if React should skip updating.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td><p>componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)</p></td>
	<td><p>is invoked immediately before updating occurs. You cannot call this.setState() here.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><p>componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)</p></td>
  <td><p>is invoked immediately after updating occurs.
</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

###Unmounting:

<table>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><p>componentWillUnmount()</p></td>
    <td><p>is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Cleanup should go here.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Notes

* `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` is a good places to put other libraries' logic.
* `component.forceUpdate()` can be invoked on any mounted component when you know that some deeper aspect of the component's state has changed without using `this.setState()`.
