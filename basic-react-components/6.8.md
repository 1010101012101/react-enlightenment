# Accessing Child Components/Nodes

If a component, when used, contains child components or React nodes inside of the component (e.g. `<Parent><Child /></Parent>` or `<Parent>test</Parent>`) these React node or component instances can be accessed by using `this.props.children`.

In the code below the `Parent` component when used, contains two `<div>` React node children, which contains React text nodes. All of the children instances, inside of the component are accessible using `this.props.children`. In the code below I access these children inside of the `Parent` `componentDidMount` lifecycle function.

The `this.props.children` of the `Parent` component instance returns an array containing the references to the child React node instances. This array is logged out to the console. Additionally, in the `Parent` component I am logging out the child of the first `<div>`.

Note how when I use the `Parent2` component inside of the `Parent` component the child React node of `Parent2` only contains one <span> React node (i.e. `<span>child2text</span>`). Thus, `this.props.children` used in `componentDidMount` lifecycle function for `Parent2` component will be a direct reference to this `<span>` React node.

### Notes

* When there is only a single child, `this.props.children` will be the single child component itself without the array wrapper. This saves an array allocation.
