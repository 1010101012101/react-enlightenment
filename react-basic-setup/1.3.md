## Using ES6 & ES* with React

Babel is not part of React. In fact, Babel's purpose isn't even that of a JSX transformer. Babel is a JavaScript compiler first.  It takes ES* code and transforms it to run in browsers that don't support ES* code. As of today, Babel mostly takes ES6 and ES7 code and transforms it into ES5 code. When it is doing these ECMAScript transformations it is also possible to configure [Babel with a React preset](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to additionally transform JSX into createElement calls. This is what we examined in the previous section.

Given that Babel is the mechanism for transforming JSX, it additionally allows a developer to write future ES* code.



#### Notes

* Obviously one can could still use Babel for it's intended purpose (i.e. compiling newer JavaScript code to older JavaScript code) without using JSX.
