# What Are Props?

The simplest way to explain props would be to say that they function similar to HTML attributes. For example, in the code below a `Badge` component is created and it is expecting a 'name' prop to be sent when the component is instantiated. Inside the render function of the `BadgeList` component, where `Badge` is used, the name prop is added to the `Badge` component much like an HTML attribute is added to an HTML element (i.e., `<Badge name="Bill" />`). The `name` prop is then used by the `Badge` component to create a `<div>` that contains a text node from the value of `this.props.name`.

Another way to think about props is that they are the configuration values sent to a component used by React nodes (i.e., literally arguments sent to a function). If you look at the non-JSX version of the previous code example it should be obvious props are just an object that get passed to the `createElement()` function.

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	displayName: "Badge",

	render: function render() {
		return React.createElement(
			"div",
			null, //no props defined, so null
			this.props.name //use passed this.prop.name as text node
		);
	}
});

var BadgeList = React.createClass({
	displayName: "BadgeList",

	render: function render() {
		return React.createElement(
			"div",
			null,
			React.createElement(Badge, { name: "Bill" }),
			React.createElement(Badge, { name: "Tom" })
		);
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(BadgeList, null), document.getElementById('app'));
```

Props themselves become an instance property (i.e., `this.props`) associated with each React node. Basically every component/React node has a unique instance property call `props` that starts as an empty JavaScript object.

In the previous code example the `BadgeList` component uses two `Badge` components each with there own `this.props` object. We can verify this by console logging out the value of `this.props` when a `Badge` component is instantiated.
