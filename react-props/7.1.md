# What are props?

The simplest way to explain component props would be to say that they function similar to HTML attributes. For example, in the code below a `Badge` component is created and it is expecting a 'name' prop to be sent when the component is instantiated. Inside the render function of the `BadgeList` component, where Badge is used, the name prop is added to the `Badge` component much like an HTML attribute is added to an HTML element. The `name` prop is then used by the `Badge` component to customize the component.

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
	}
});

var BadgeList = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return (<div>
			<Badge name="Bill" />
			<Badge name="Tom" />
		</div>);
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(<BadgeList />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Another way to think about props is that they are the configuration values sent to a component.

Props themselves are an instance property object associated with each component. In the previous code example the `BadgeList` component uses two `Badge` components each with there own `this.props` object. We can verify that by console logging out the value of `this.props` when a `Badge` component is instantiated.
