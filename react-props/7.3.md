# Getting Component Props

As discussed in section 6.5 a component instance can be accessed from within the component from any configuration function by using the `this` keyword. For example, in the code below the `this` keyword is used to access the `Badge` `props` from the render function (i.e. `this.props.name`).

```
var Badge = React.createClass({
	render: function() {
		return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(<Badge name="Bill" />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

#### Notes

* A components properties should be consider immutable and components should not alter internally the properties sent to them from above. If you need to alter the properties of a component then a re-render should occur, don't set props by adding them to `this.props.`.
