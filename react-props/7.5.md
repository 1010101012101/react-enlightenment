# Component Props More Than Strings

Before looking at validating props one needs to make sure they understand that a component prop can be any valid JavaScript value.

In the code example below I setup several default props containing several different JavaScript values.

Note how the  `propArray` and `propObject` were overwritten with new values when the `MyComponent` instance is created.

The main take away here is that you are not limited to string values when passing prop values.
