# Setting Default Component Props

Default props can be set when a component is being defined by using the `getDefaultProps` configuration value.

In the code example below, the `Badge` component has a default value for the `name` prop.

Default props will be set on `this.props` if no prop is sent into the component. You can verify this by the fact that the `Badge` component instance with no `name` prop uses the default name `'John Doe'`.

#### Notes

* The `getDefaultProps` is invoked once and cached when the component is created.
* The `getDefaultProps` is run before any instances are created thus using `this.props` inside of the `getDefaultProps` will not work.
* Any objects returned by `getDefaultProps()` will be shared across instances, not copied.
