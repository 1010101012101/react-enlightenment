# Creating Stateless Function Components

When a component is purely a result of `props` alone, no `state`, the component can be written as a pure function avoiding the need to create a React component instance. In the code example below `MyComponent` is the result of a function that returns the results `React.createElement()`.

Having look at the same code not using JSX should clarify what is going on.

```
var MyComponent = function MyComponent(props) {
	return React.createElement(
		"div",
		null,
		"Hello ",
		props.name
	);
};

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(MyComponent, { name: "doug" }), app);
```

Constructing a React component without calling `React.createClass()` is typically referred to as a stateless function component.

Stateless function components can't be passed component options (i.e., `render`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.). However `.propTypes` and `.defaultProps` can be set as properties on the function.

The code example below demonstrates a stateless function component making use of `.propTypes` and `.defaultProps`.

#### Notes

* Make as many of your components as possible, as stateless components
