# Working with Component State

Working with component state typically involves setting a components default state, accessing the current state, and updating the state.

In the code example below I am creating a `<MoodComponent />` that demonstrates the use of `getInitialState`, `this.state.[STATE]`, and `this.setState()`. If you click on the component in a web browser (i.e. the face) then it will cycle through the states (i.e. moods) available. Thus, the component has three potential states, tied to the UI, based on clicks from the UI user. Go ahead and click on the face in the results tab below.

Note that the `<MoodComponent />` has an initial state of ':|', that is set using  `getInitialState: function() {return {mood: ':|'};}`, which is used in the component when it is first rendered by writing, `{this.state.mood}`.

To change the state, an event listener is added, in this case a click event (i.e. `onChange`) on the `<span>` node that will call the `changeMood` function. Within this function I use `this.setState()` to cycle to the next mood based on the current mood/state. After the state is update (i.e. `setState()` merges the changes) the component will re-render itself and the UI will change.
